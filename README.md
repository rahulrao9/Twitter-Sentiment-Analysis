# Twitter Sentiment Analysis
Twitter allows businesses to engage personally with consumers. However, there’s so much data on Twitter that it can be hard for brands to prioritize which tweets or mentions to respond to first.

That's why sentiment analysis has become a key instrument in social media marketing strategies.

Sentiment analysis is a tool that automatically monitors emotions in conversations on social media platforms

Carefully listening to the voice of the customer on Twitter using sentiment analysis allows companies to understand their audience, keep on top of what’s being said about their brand – and their competitors – and discover new trends in the industry.

# What Is Sentiment Analysis?
Sentiment analysis is the automated process of identifying and classifying subjective information in text data. This might be an opinion, a judgment, or a feeling about a particular topic or product feature.

The most common type of sentiment analysis is ‘polarity detection’ and involves classifying statements as Positive, Negative or Neutral.
