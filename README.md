Sentiment analysis, also referred to as opinion mining, is an approach to natural language processing (NLP) that identifies the emotional tone behind a body of text. This is a popular way for organizations to determine and categorize opinions about a product, service or idea. Sentiment analysis involves the use of data mining, machine learning (ML), artificial intelligence and computational linguistics to mine text for sentiment and subjective information such as whether it is expressing positive, negative or neutral feelings.

Sentiment analysis systems help organizations gather insights into real-time customer sentiment, customer experience and brand reputation. Generally, these tools use text analytics to analyze online sources such as emails, blog posts, online reviews, customer support tickets, news articles, survey responses, case studies, web chats, tweets, forums and comments. Algorithms are used to implement rule-based, automatic or hybrid methods of scoring whether the customer is expressing positive words, negative words or neutral ones.

In addition to identifying sentiment, sentiment analysis can extract the polarity or the amount of positivity and negativity, subject and opinion holder within the text. This approach is used to analyze various parts of text, such as a full document or a paragraph, sentence or subsentence.
